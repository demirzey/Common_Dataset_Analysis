# Common_Dataset_Analysis
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the DFW Universities' Common Datasets to identify enrollment trends, graduation patterns, and financial aid distribution. Leveraged Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and statistical methods to compare the university's performance with peer institutions, highlighting competitive advantages and areas for improvement. Applied an unsupervised machine learning model, k-means clustering, and a supervised machine learning model, decision tree, to predict future student satisfaction. Developed clear, visual reports to effectively communicate findings to academic stakeholders and support data-driven decision-making
